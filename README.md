# Video Streaming Platform

Welcome to our video streaming platform project! This project is designed to demonstrate and test the capabilities of several cutting-edge technologies in a cohesive environment. Our goal is to create a robust video streaming service.

## Technologies Used

This project integrates several technologies:

-   **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need fast, interactive user experiences.
-   **Keycloak**: An open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services.
-   **Docker**: A set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to create a video streaming platform where users can:

-   Stream videos efficiently and securely.
-   Manage access and user authentication using Keycloak.
-   Utilize Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
